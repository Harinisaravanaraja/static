             Knowledge representation mechanisms in AI refer to the ways in which a computer program can store, organize, and retrieve knowledge to perform tasks such as reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Some common knowledge representation mechanisms include:
             1. Semantic Networks: A graph-based representation of knowledge, where nodes represent concepts and arcs represent relationships.
             2. Frames: A structured representation of knowledge, using slots and fillers to describe attributes and values.
